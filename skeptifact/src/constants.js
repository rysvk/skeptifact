    paragraphs: [
      "Skepticism, in its rational form, isn’t about doubting everything — it’s about refusing to accept claims without adequate evidence, especially when those claims trigger strong emotions, affirm our biases, or come from sources with unclear motives. A healthy skeptic asks, “How do we know this is true?” rather than “I bet this is false.” This mindset keeps you grounded in reality, protects you from manipulation, and forces arguments to earn your trust rather than extract it. In a world where information spreads faster than verification, skepticism becomes less a philosophical stance and more a survival trait.",

    heading: "What is Fact Checking ?",
    paragraphs: [
      "Fact-checking is the practical tool that operationalizes skepticism. It means looking for primary sources, checking dates, verifying quotes, and understanding the context before forming an opinion. Good fact-checking also includes checking your own reasoning: Am I accepting this because it aligns with what I want to believe? Am I rejecting it because it challenges my worldview? This internal audit is just as important as checking external information, because cognitive biases — confirmation bias, motivated reasoning, availability bias — distort perception long before faulty data enters the picture.",

    heading: "Why are they important ?",
    paragraphs: [
      "Importantly, skepticism pairs with intellectual humility. Sometimes the correct conclusion is not “true” or “false,” but “insufficient evidence.” Accepting uncertainty is uncomfortable, but it’s intellectually honest. It prevents premature judgments, polarization, and the spread of misinformation disguised as confidence.",
      "Ultimately, skepticism and fact-checking are about maintaining autonomy of thought. In an environment where algorithms, influencers, and institutions all compete to shape your beliefs, the ability to verify claims before accepting them is a quiet form of resistance — a way of preserving your freedom to think clearly, independently, and rationally.",
